1) Add user email
2) We may need next roles
    1) global admin - admin
    2) moderator for courses (by default moderator can create course, add collaborators
        can update and delete coure, can add exercises to course)
    3) collaborator can add exercises to course, maybe can update some entities
        (maybe moderator can approve this), he cant delete course and cant delete exercises
    4) user without rights
3) we may need to have table that stores modifications

4) we need to add data to like comments to solution
5) we need to create two entities (many to many) courses_users, exercises_users
