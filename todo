1) Add user jbuild serializer !!!                       + 
2) Move all data from active serializer to jbuilder     + 
3) Add default value is active true for comments        +
4) Add Commnets (Check comments properly)               -+
        1) Check create comment course, assignment, solution
        2) Check get one comment by id
        3) Check get list comments by profile
        4) Check get list comments by profile and id
        5) Search comments (comment id, profile, profile + id)

        1) Test moderator, collaborator, user references to course can see commentaries
        2) Test moderator, collaborator, owner can modify comments 
        3) Check that other users cant modify comments exlude comments to solutions
        
5) TODO check user email 
6) Add custom error views
7) Add /api/v1/mycourses
8) Add admin 
9) Also think about old demands 
        1) We may need next roles
        -    1) global admin - admin ??
        +-    2) moderator for courses (by default moderator can create course, add collaborators
                can update and delete coure, can add exercises to course) 
                Moderator added + 
                Add collaborator ??? 
        +-    3) collaborator can add exercises to course, maybe can update some entities
                (maybe moderator can approve this), he cant delete course and cant delete exercises
                Role added + 
                Approve ???? think about this
        +    4) user without rights + 
        # think about this
        2) we may need to have table that stores modifications
        3) we need to add data to like comments to solution
        4) we need to create two entities (many to many) courses_users, exercises_users +
